**When & where should I apply for my visa?**

If you require a visa to travel to the Canada, we recommend starting the application process as soon as you know that you will attend COLM, as the wait time for the mandatory in-person visa appointment can be highly variable.

**What should I bring to my visa interview?**

The IRCC provides guidance on required documentation for a visitor visa interview. Please also check the specific requirements of the embassy or consulate that will conduct your interview.

Beyond required documents, you may be able to provide supplemental supporting documents online and/or in a visa interview, subject to the procedure of the specific embassy or consulate. Supplemental supporting documents should aid in establishing your residence and ties abroad and thus your ability and intent to leave Canada after the visit. Examples of such supporting documents include:

* Invitation letter: The invitation letter issued to you by COLM.  
* Travel plan: Complete itinerary of your intended travel, including booking confirmation of a return flight and of accommodation during your stay.  
* Financial support: Evidence of ability to pay for the trip or confirmation of funding provided for flights, accommodation, food, and incidental costs.  
* Continuing status: Official documentation to prove you are a student, post-doc, or employee and that you will return to your country/region of residence for continuing studies or employment; evidence of familial ties in your country/region of residence.

**If I receive a visa am I guaranteed to be able to enter Canada to attend COLM?**

Unfortunately, it is possible that the immigration officer that processes your entry into Canada (usually, at the airport after landing in Canada) may require you to undergo a secondary interview to make an immigration determination. Please travel prepared for this possibility, and carry on your person the same evidence you presented at your visa appointment, including a printed copy of your COLM invitation letter.
