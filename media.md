The Conference on Language Modeling "COLM" program requires individuals applying for accreditation to be professional journalists and represent media organizations. COLM reserves the right to deny or withdraw accreditation of journalists from media organizations if any actions are deemed improper or inconsistent with the principles of the Organization.

## Press Accreditation Qualifications

Press accreditation is strictly reserved for members of the press. Applicants must show they are professional members of the press with a proven track record. Media accreditation is not accorded to the information outlets or advocacy publications of non-governmental organizations.

## Accreditation Process

To begin, you will need the following information. The names and information entered are for purposes of identification and verification only and will not be published for general access. This information will be retained in the system for reference unless a written request to remove it is received.

### Required Information:

- E-mail address
- Complete name
- Name of organization
- Organization Website
- Read and confirm you agree to the [Code of Conduct](/CoC.html)

We will ask you to submit recent articles that demonstrate a track record of reporting and demonstrate active engagement in covering the activities of AI research. Samples must be unaltered clippings or media products from the organization written by the individual requesting accreditation.

## Receiving Accreditation

Every effort will be made to issue the accreditation as soon as possible. Applications are considered on a case-by-case basis and the decisions are final. Accreditation covers the duration of the conference. Double registration is not allowed. If you are already registered as an attendee or sponsor, your application for press accreditation will not be granted.

Freelance journalists are subject to the same requirements for accreditation and must complete the full process. Freelance journalists, including photographers, must provide clear evidence they are on assignment from a specific news organization or publication. A valid assignment letter from that news organization, or publication, is required. Photographic agencies must provide clear evidence from a client news organization or publication. You must also submit the other required documents for accreditation.

COLM is making efforts to take on broad new forms of information dissemination and social networking. Accreditation of bloggers for COLM meetings will be done on a case-by-case basis and criteria currently applied to online media will be applied. We are aware that assignments can change on short notice. Please communicate changes to staff as soon as they are known. The applicant will have to complete the same process, but as long as they have the required valid materials, there is usually little delay in processing. An organization that welcomes citizen journalists and has no apparent editorial board oversight would not be eligible for accreditation.

## Accreditation Approval

Once you have received confirmation of accreditation, you will be registered for the conference. When attending the conference, your registration will be processed as a complimentary registration, and you will receive an email confirmation for the conference.

## Access

All accredited press are granted full access to the in-person events.

## Disclaimer

The ICLR General Chair reserves the right to deny or withdraw accreditation for activities that violate the principles of the [Code of Conduct](/CoC.html) and/or ethics of journalism and/or COLM. At any time, the COLM General Chair may revoke accreditation if it is put to improper use, if it has been used to abuse the privileges so extended, or if personal conduct is not consistent with the best interest of the organization.
