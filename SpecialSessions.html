                  <p>A vast majority of research on large language models focus on a handful of major languages such as English, Chinese, and German. Recent LLMs are capable of understanding and generating many more languages, but their performance drops dramatically for medium- and low-resource languages. We discuss why it is important to improve multilingual LLMs, how to measure progress, and what the major research challenges are.</p>

                          <p>Helen Nissenbaum is the Andrew H. and Ann R. Tisch Professor of Information Science and the founding director of the Digital Life Initiative at Cornell Tech. Her research spans issues of bias, trust, security, autonomy, and accountability in digital systems, and, most notably, privacy as contextual integrity. Professor Nissenbaum&#39;s publications include the books Obfuscation: A User&#39;s Guide for Privacy and Protest, with Finn Brunton (MIT Press, 2015), Values at Play in Digital Games, with Mary Flanagan (MIT Press, 2014), and Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life (Stanford, 2010). These, along with numerous research articles, have been translated into seven languages, including Polish, Chinese, and Portuguese. She received the 2014 Barwise Prize from the American Philosophical Association and the IACAP Covey Award for computing, ethics, and philosophy. Professor Nissenbaum has also contributed to privacy-enhancing free software -- TrackMeNot (designed to prevent the profiling of web search histories) and  AdNauseam (designed to counter profiling based on ad clicks). She holds a Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford University and a B.A. (Hons) in Philosophy and Mathematics from the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.</p>

                              <p>Emily Black is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at New York University. Her research concerns fairness and accountability in AI systems. In other words, she creates methods to determine whether AI systems will cause harm to the public, studies the equity impacts of AI systems in high-stakes settings, such as the government, and connects her own and related research to the legal and policy worlds to help better regulate AI systems. Professor Black’s work is interdisciplinary as she aims to prevent harm from AI systems used in a variety of contexts: she works with lawyers, accountants, civil society advocates, and others to try to prevent algorithmic harm in practice.</p>
