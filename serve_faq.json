{"FAQ":[{"QA":[{"Answer":"COLM will be run on OpenReview. Submissions will open in the beginning of next year.","Question":"When is the COLM submission open?"},{"Answer":"COLM will use the following policy, adapted from NeurIPS: 'Non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) are permitted, though preprints in the style must use the new \u201cpreprint\u201d option, rather than the \u201cfinal\u201d option. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit work to COLM that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it; however, previously published papers by the authors on related topics must be cited (with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing; see below).","Question":"What is the COLM preprint policy?"}],"Section":"Submission Structure"},{"QA":[{"Answer":"We are actively looking for sponsors for the event.
