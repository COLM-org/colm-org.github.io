Her work and interests revolve around language use in context, including computational semantics and pragmatics, dialogue interaction, visually-grounded language processing, and language learning, among others. Her group carries out research on these topics at the interface of computational linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Raquel studied language and cognitive science in Barcelona, her home city, and received her PhD in computational linguistics from King's College London. Before moving to Amsterdam, she held research positions at the Linguistics Department of the University of Potsdam and at the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University. Over the course of her career, she has been awarded several prestigious personal fellowships by the Dutch Research Council and is the recipient of a European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant.","image":"/static/images/speakers/raquel.png","institution":"University of Amsterdam","session":"TDB","speaker":"Raquel Fern\u00e1ndez","title":"TBD"},{"UID":"3","abstract":"TBD","bio":"Dr. Fedorenko is a cognitive neuroscientist who studies the human language system and its relationship with other systems in the brain. She received her Bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard University in 2002, and her Ph.D. from MIT in 2007. She was then awarded a K99R00 Pathway to Independence Career Development Award from NIH. In 2014, she joined the faculty at MGH/HMS, and in 2019 she returned to MIT where she is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research. Dr. Fedorenko uses fMRI, intracranial recordings and stimulation, EEG, MEG, and computational modeling, to study adults and children, including individuals with developmental and acquired brain disorders, and individuals with structurally atypical brains, but typical-like cognition.","image":"/static/images/speakers/ev.png","institution":"MIT","session":"TDB","speaker":"Evelina Fedorenko","title":"TBD"},{"UID":"4","abstract":"TBD","bio":"Hanna Hajishirzi is the Torode Family Associate Professor in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a Senior Director of NLP at AI2. Her current research delves into various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular emphasis on accelerating the science of language modeling, broadening their scope, and enhancing their applicability and usefulness for human lives. She has published over 140 scientific articles in prestigious journals and conferences across ML, AI, NLP, and Computer Vision. She is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER Award, Intel Rising Star Award, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, Academic Achievement UIUC Alumni Award, and was a finalist for the Innovator of the Year Award by GeekWire.
