[{"UID":"1","abstract":"Language Models have been around for decades but have suddenly taken the world by storm. In a surprising third act for anyone doing NLP in the 70s, 80s, 90s, or 2000s, in much of the popular media, artificial intelligence is now synonymous with language models. In this talk, I want to take a look backward at where language models came from and why they were so slow to emerge, a look inward to give my thoughts on meaning, intelligence, and what language models understand and know, and a look forward at what we need to build intelligent language-using agents in a world. I will argue that material beyond language is not necessary to having meaning and understanding, but it is very useful in most cases, and that adaptability and learning are vital to intelligence, and so the current strategy of building from huge curated data will not truly get us there, even though LLMs have so many good uses. For a web agent, I look at how it can learn through interactions and make good use of the hierarchical structure of language to make exploration tractable. I will show recent work with Shikhar Murty about how an interaction-first learning approach for web agents can work very effectively, giving gains of 20 percent on MiniWoB++ over either a zero-shot language model agent or an instruction-first fine-tuned agent.","bio":"Christopher Manning is the inaugural Thomas M.

Some challenges that had been core roadblocks in natural language processing for decades \u2013 such as inferring rich representations for language understanding and generating fluent and complex text \u2013 have now mostly been overcome. An exciting consequence of this is that we can now dive into more nuanced problems within the language sciences. Two frontiers in the computational modelling of language use \u2013 which we should arguably be better equipped to tackle now \u2013 concern perceptual grounding and social interaction. In this talk, I will review some of the current challenges of language models regarding these frontiers, present some recent work on multimodal and conversational grounding, and argue that there is still substantial progress to be made and plenty of interesting open questions ahead of us.","bio":"Raquel Fern\u00e1ndez is Full Professor of Computational Linguistics and Dialogue Systems at the Institute for Logic, Language & Computation, University of Amsterdam, where she leads the Dialogue Modelling Group.

Patient investigations and neuroimaging studies have delineated a network of left frontal and temporal brain areas that support language processing, and work in my group has established that this \u201clanguage network\u201d is robustly dissociated from both lower-level speech perception and articulation mechanisms, and from systems of knowledge and reasoning (Fedorenko et al. 2024a Nat Rev Neurosci; Fedorenko et al., 2024b Nature). The areas of the language network appear to support computations related to lexical access, syntactic structure building, and semantic composition, and the processing of individual word meanings and combinatorial linguistic processing are not segregated spatially: every language area is sensitive to both (e.g., Shain, Kean et al., 2024 JOCN). In spite of substantial progress in our understanding of the human language system, the precise computations that underlie our ability to extract meaning from word sequences have remained out of reach, in large part due to the limitations of human neuroscience approaches. But a real revolution happened a few years ago: a candidate model organism emerged, albeit not a biological one, for the study of language\u2014neural network language models (LMs), such as GPT-2 and its successors. These models exhibited human-level performance on diverse language tasks, including those long argued to only be solvable by humans, and often producing human-like output. Inspired by the LMs\u2019 linguistic prowess, we tested whether the internal representations of these models are similar to the representations in the human brain when processing the same linguistic inputs, and found that indeed LM representations predict neural responses in the human language areas (Schrimpf et al. 2021 PNAS). This model-to-brain representational similarity opens a lot of exciting doors to investigations of human language processing mechanisms (for a review see Tuckute et al., 2024 Ann Rev Neurosci). I will discuss several lines of recent and ongoing work, including a demonstration that LMs align to brains even after a relatively small amount of training (Hosseini et al., 2024 Neurobio of Lang), a closed-loop neuromodulation approach to identify the linguistic features that most strongly drive the language system (Tuckute et al., 2024 Nat Hum Beh), and work on the universality of representations across LMs and between LMs and brains (Hosseini et al., in prep.).","bio":"Dr. Fedorenko is a cognitive neuroscientist who studies the human language system and its relationship with other systems in the brain.

As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the significance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, I argue that it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs.  In this talk, I present our OLMo project aimed at building strong language models and making them fully accessible to researchers along with open-source code for data, training, and inference. I describe our efforts in building language modeling from scratch, expanding their scope to make them applicable and useful for real-world applications, and investigating a new generation of LMs that address fundamental challenges inherent in current models.","bio":"Hanna Hajishirzi is the Torode Family Associate Professor in the Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a Senior Director of NLP at AI2.
